## Cognitive Robotics

### Natural language understanding for behavior-based robotic indoor navigation
As part of my master thesis, we investigate novel deep neural network architectures and mechanisms that could improve the generalization of a language model that translates free-form unconstrained directions in English to a series of high-level behaviors that a robot should execute to comply with the instruction.

Some of the techniques that we are currently researching consider:

- [Multi-head Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00697)
- [Graph Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903)
- [Compositional Attentive Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03067)


## Recommender Systems

### Session-based recommendations
We have [implemented](https://github.com/paxcema/KerasGRU4Rec) a seminal [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06939) on session-based recommendations for e-commerce in the Keras framework. Follow-up work contemplates migration to the TensorFlow 2.0 backend.

Another effort currently underway considers the use of [Neural ODEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366) for the same task.
