## Counterfactual recommendation systems
As part of my teaching assistant duties for the graduate [course](http://dparra.sitios.ing.uc.cl/classes/recsys-2019-2/) in recommender systems at PUC Chile, the slides (in spanish) of my counterfactual recommendation tutorial can be found [here](/assets/pdfs/RecoGym.pdf). An english version is coming out soon.

## Paper review (Sunderhauf, 2019): Navigating with GCNs

Presented in a weekly meeting at the [AI Lab's](http://ialab.ing.puc.cl) cognitive robotics group, we review the paper "Where are the keys? Learning object-centric navigation policies on semantic maps with graph convolutional networks" by [Niko Sunderhauf](https://nikosuenderhauf.github.io/).
