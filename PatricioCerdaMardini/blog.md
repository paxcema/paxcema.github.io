# Blog
Here you can find my blog, where I sporadically submit things that are interesting to me.

[*PENDING*] Link to entries, each post on its own!

## Course material ([*IIC3633*](http://dparra.sitios.ing.uc.cl/classes/recsys-2019-2/)): counterfactual recommendation systems

Slides (in spanish) can be found [here](/assets/pdfs/RecoGym.pdf). An english version is coming out soon-ish.

## Paper review: Learning Navigation Policies with GCNs (Sunderhauf, 2019)

Presented in a weekly meeting at the [lab's](http://ialab.ing.puc.cl) cognitive robotics group, we review Niko Sunderhauf's work, "Where are the keys? Learning object-centric navigation policies on semantic maps with graph convolutional networks".

## How to embed Common Lisp in C using ECL

Wow, what a weird use case scenario, you might be thinking. It turns out Common Lisp is an extremely robust, fast -and above all- *fun* language to use.

With its Embeddable implementation (ECL) we can easily compile down to shared libraries that can then be called from pretty much anywhere, as long as we use a C-compliant foreign function interface.

First step is to actually download the ECL binaries. The latest release as of this post is 3 years old, which might sound like abandonware, but it's actually a healthy project that just works (the next release should be out this year).

## Paper review: Interactively Picking Objects Through Language (Hatori et al, 2017)

Presented in a weekly meeting at the [lab's](http://ialab.ing.puc.cl) cognitive robotics group, we review Preferred Networks' work, "Interactively Picking Real-World Objects with Unconstrained Spoken Language Instructions".

## Connecting Python and InterBase

In this post, we take a look at using the ubiquitous programming language, Python, with a rather obscure (as in, not particularly popular nowadays) database engine: Embarcadero's InterBase.

InterBase presents a strong suite of features and solid performance. It is specially atractive when doing rapid application development ("RAD") with Embarcardero's C++ RAD Studio, thanks to some superb integration between both products.

However, if one strays away from the C++ world things start to get hairy. This is troublesome when wanting to use a high-level language (such as Python) for light exploratory tasks outside the main C++ app.

At first glance, the simple task of connecting a Python process with InterBase's engine sounds trivial, but it turns out there are some considerations to be had.

## Paper review: Deep Learning Behavioral Indoor Navigation (Sepúlveda et al, 2018)

Presented in a weekly meeting at the [lab's](http://ialab.ing.puc.cl) cognitive robotics group, we review our very own Gabriel Sepúlveda's work, "A Deep Learning Based Behavioral Approach to Indoor Autonomous Navigation".
