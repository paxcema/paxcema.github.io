Hello! I am a second year master's student in machine learning at [IA Lab](http://ialab.ing.puc.cl), the artificial intelligence lab in the School of Engineering at Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.

My main area of research is cognitive robotics, with an emphasis on navigation through language understanding. Additionally, I am interested in recommender systems, particularly on session-based approaches for e-commerce.

My bachelor's degree (2017) is in software engineering. I currently work part-time at [CINI Software](https://www.cinisoftware.cl) as a full stack engineer. In the past, I've interned as a machine learning engineer at [EY Metric Arts's](https://www.ey.com/es_cl/eymetricarts) video analytics team.

In this website you can find links to the research projects I've worked on, as well as a blog where I'll post content on research and varied software engineering stuff. Enjoy!
