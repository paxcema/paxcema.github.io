Hello! I am a second year master's student at [IA Lab](http://ialab.ing.puc.cl), the artificial intelligence lab in the School of Engineering at Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.

My main area of research is cognitive robotics, with an emphasis on visual language navigation. Additionally, I am interested in Recommender Systems, particularly on session-based approaches for e-commerce.
